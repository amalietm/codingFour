App development studio


Description: 

Museum / gallery app that provides information about artwork's, artist's, era's and the museum itself. 

The app is meant to be focused on providing something for a community. The community chosen to focus on is people with interest in art; any age group can visit a gallery with the wish to simply look and appreciate some art. 

The app provides the information often lacking at galleries, which then often leaves the observer confused and without all the facts to fully appreciate an artwork and the thoughts behind it. 

The app itself is not done. To give you an impression as to what it will be if further developed, the top suggestions of each menu category takes you to a page showing the layout. Ex, Artist -> Frida Kahlo. 

There are elements lacking, as presented in the wireframes ex. the option to enlarge pictures or an image carousel. However, within the time frame not everything was possible.
